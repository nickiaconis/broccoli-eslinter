# [broccoli](https://github.com/joliss/broccoli)-eslinter [DEPRECATED]

> Lint JavaScript using [Eslint](http://eslint.org/)

~~This is a fork of [jonathanKingston/broccoli-lint-eslint](https://github.com/jonathanKingston/broccoli-lint-eslint) used to change the test generator API. This fork may go away, however it will attempt to track it's parent fork as long as possible.~~

This fork is **DEPRECATED**! Please use [broccoli-lint-eslint](https://github.com/jonathanKingston/broccoli-lint-eslint) instead. It now provides test generator functions enough information to differentiate between errors and warnings. Since that was the goal of broccoli-eslinter, broccoli-eslinter is no longer necessary.
